**The People who have the passion, even if they fail a lot in their lives
They never give up
And they always inspired by  succeed people that makes them insist on reaching the top ,unlike the fixed mindset that are seen in the success of people
Negative energy for their lives and a negative motivation for them
The fixed mindset believes trouble is devastating
growth mindset  believe in themselves and consider the stages of failure as a starting point for greater success
Their motto in life is no success without failure also
Success requires a lot of patience, passion and experience
to reach it**

***lets now discuss the differents between the fixed and growth mindset***:+1:

**In a fixed mindset, people believe their qualities are fixed traits and therefore cannot change. These people document their intelligence and talents rather than working to develop and improve them. They also believe that talent alone leads to success, and effort is not required.** 

**Alternatively, in a growth mindset, people have an underlying belief that their learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. When people believe they can become smarter, they realize that their effort has an effect on their success, so they put in extra time, leading to higher achievement**
