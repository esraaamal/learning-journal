# css
if we want to change the style of the web 
their is many  way one of them 
by put <style > command inside the head command
the second way is by create a new css file and 
put this command

 #website_header{
color:red; 
font-size:35px;
 font-weight:bold ; 
}

this symbol (#)
is  related for id command
so after this command
 #website_header{
color:red; 
font-size:35px;
 font-weight:bold ; 
}

we must write 
<nav id="website_header">
This is my website
</nav>
command befor the prior command
