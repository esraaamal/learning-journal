# To write a code you must first know what are the computer and how does it work !
**Show some step to know what make computer is computer**
1-how information is  represented using  electricity  inside the  motherboard
2-how computer use circuit And connecting each others

3-research for the' 4' computer component
he executing cycile
Input,CPU,memory and the output
And how store all this huge informatuon

The Four taskes that make the computer is a computer
1- input
2-storage(database)
3-Processing data
4-output result
What computer has evolved
You will still be working on the four steps

# Let's talk about input devices 
Like a keyboard, mouse scan printer

_So all that devices send the information to the memory to be storage_
What processing  task do?
A processing is an algorithm( Mathematical equations)
That process the information from memory 
Then

Give a result to the output

How computer understand our language
By convert it to binary (0,1)

Wire and circuit carry all the information
 in computer
The signal electricity should be 
One or zero to deal with computer
Convert the decimel numb sysy to binary numb sys
8 wires can story decimal numbers between 0-255
